# Sprint 1

This first week hasn't been my expectation. This isn't to imply a negative connotation, but just an observation. It reminds me of when my sister taught me how to swim. She pushed me in the deep end and if I didn't come back up she fished me out. Long story short, I learned to swim.

## Looking to the future
I'm not sure if excited or eager is the right way to desribe how I feel for the upcoming content, I would use ambivalent. This feeling comes from not understanding the intricancies of tools and knowing I will have to move on anyways. It may come to me as we go, but I'm not clairvoyant so I'm gonna focus on not being so tempermental when faced with adversity.

### Cool Code Snippet?
Not sure what you want, but here is what it took to center an image. This is important because I discovered you can't center an image in html unless you resize it first.

# Sprint 2

## What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?

I wish I could develop custom images in CSS. I have attempted it multiple times but don't have the "know how" and struggle to break through snags.

## What are you struggling with?

I am struggling with GIT. Other than not understanding the syntax of markdown at first, most of my struggles have been with making GIT do what I want. 

## How do you solve a problem? 

### I try to solve issues in a methodical process IOT better get a grasp on my left and right limits. Sometimes this expands my abilities and other times I use this process to solve the problems at hand. Anyways look below for how I breakdown issues.

1. I try to troubleshoot the issue by seeing what makes it break. Sometimes this doesny work if I am just beggining on a task or don't have enough of an understanding of the program or action to know where to start trouble shooting. If this is the case, I waste no time and move to step 2.
2. I browse forums/PAI for anecdotal experiences IOT to move closer to the solution. An example of this would be when I found a post detailing an issue with where there was no "master" branch. Having prior knowledge from an Awesome Inc resource that "master" became "main", I then was able to move forward with the solution that still worked. Outdated terminology or not I was resourceful with the knowledge.
3. Apply the solution! if it doesnt work, repeat step 2.

## What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
Thats a hard question to answer because if my methods don't work I normally sleep on it or do something else to take my mind off the issue. Once I come back to the issue, I see if I can come at it from a new perspective. 

If all else fails, I ask someone for a hand in understanding the issue. I think of the second person as a wall to rebound ideas off of. I normally repeat things for clarity and understanding. 

A flaw in my process is my ability to fail and be frustrated. I am not resillient and struggle to pick myself back up after failure. I need time to cool off wich doesn't gel well with time restrictions.
